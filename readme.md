Welcome to Patnan Investment, where your real estate dreams find their perfect match. Since our establishment in 2009, we've been dedicated to enhancing your investments and delivering unparalleled value every step of the way.

At the heart of our business lies a commitment to professionalism, integrity, and transparency. Whether you're seeking prime plots of land with title deeds along the upcoming Greater Eastern Bypass or serene, modern apartments in the bustling Saika region, we're here to connect you with affordable properties that exceed your expectations.

Our properties in Joska, Malaa, KBC, and Solace are more than just addresses; they're opportunities for financial growth and comfortable living. Just 15 kilometers from Nairobi CBD and 8 kilometers from the Eastern Bypass, our locations offer convenience without compromising on tranquility or modernity.

Real estate isn't just an investment—it's a cornerstone of financial security and personal well-being. That's why we're dedicated to delivering top-notch quality services that go beyond the transaction to build lasting relationships with our clients.

With a color palette inspired by nature—green and yellow-brown—we aim to create a website that reflects the harmony and stability our properties offer. Our logo embodies our values of trustworthiness and reliability, serving as a beacon of assurance to our clients.

As you navigate our site, you'll find essential sections like Home, About Us, Services, Gallery, and Contacts, where you can easily locate us on a map or reach out via phone or email. Our office location, nestled next to Saika estate along Kangundo road, is conveniently situated for all your needs.

Drawn to websites like ACK St. Peters Church, Kahawa Sukari, and Africa Grant Advisors, we're inspired by their simplicity and clarity of information. In two months' time, we'll unveil our new online presence—a platform that captures the essence of Patnan Investment while providing a seamless user experience.

For inquiries or to explore our offerings further, reach out to us at 0717 818598 or patnaninvestment@gmail.com. We look forward to being your trusted partner in real estate as we embark on this journey together.
